===============================
+ 4.7.7 + ( Current )
===============================
> Improved way poll results are show; now looks more astheticly pleasing when
  the bars or string lentgh is shorter or longer than expected.
> Bugfix: Results and vote buttons for poll panel now POST an extra var to the
  current page to make it swap between results and vote.
> Bugfix: The getimage action in the files module low accounts for bandwidth       usage when loading cached images.
> Bugfix: When an admin modifies a member's profile and dosen't change the
  userlevel, the old access protocol is now retained.
> Small caching feature implemeted to speed up downloading of smaller files
  such as avatars and logos. Note: ONLY works for 'getimage' action.
> Source structure all moved into one folder / SQL archives nolonger kept
  on public dev website.
> Users are now able to customize where panels appear on their screen.
> Panels can now be placed either side of the screen in any order, as set by the
  theme configuration file.
> Minor security rules added to stop bots/crawlers from causing spam in the 
  admin's inbox because of disabled websites.
> Page limiter depreciated on global and private settings pages; in the future,
  users will be able to be more specific to each module.
> Depreciated advanced security protocol editor to improve scalability with
  templates.

===============================
+ 4.6.5 + ( Released 07/01/03 )
===============================
> Cleaned up unused tags / blocks in templates to improve scalability.
> Depreciated print page feature to make templates more dynamic and less
  dependent on unused features.
> Merged a huge number of sql queries to make system more efficient.
> Security/module coding structure seporated to improve scalability.
> If no birthdate is added on member's profile, then instead of todays date
  being used as default, no date is now used, making the field hidden on their
  profile.
> Buddies are now nolonger re-counted in server details and server watch,
  used to show multiple buddies in the list and incorrect buddy count.
> When errors are generated on CMS, the admin is now emailed a full detail
  of the server vars associated with the client which triggered the error.
> Fixed minor bug where 1 item is always accidentaly deleted when using the
  re-arrange order feature on the members and servers admins.
> Email function is nolonger HTML by default, and admin email address is never
  revieled to the public (this is taken over by support_email).
> Improved error reporting; now informs admin of all errors caused in the
  modules.php script.
> The latest feature which enables the user to add and remove poll options
  without having to change the page needs all the options to be deleted upon
  updating the poll. This makes it so all votes cast so far are valid as the
  option which they voted for now has a different ID. To solve this, all votes
  cast are deleted when a poll is edited. The user is not warned of this yet!

=============== 
+ 4.5.5 + ( Released 19/12/03 )
===============
> Implemented row controler in the Polls module (edit and create actions).
> Map controler converted to a row controler, so it can be used across
  multiple modules / templates.
> Map controler now fully implemented in the fixtures module under the create
  and edit actions. The script used for this is almost identical to that of
  the scores controler used on the results module - will consider merging them.
> SQL date format function now supports hours, minutes and seconds.
> Fixtures controler class now installed in the fixtures module which handles
  both inserting and updating fixtures.
> Clan selector is now a global block that can be used in any module.

  filenames in the 'Select Screenshot' dropdown box.

=============== 
+ 4.5.0 + ( Released 16/12/03 )
===============
> Results module now has a combined insert and update action to cut down
  on future development time; scores are removed then re-added upon updating
  the result to maintain a clean database.
> On results module in the create & edit utilities, scores are now modified
  using JavaScript, and when the user selects a clan from the CMS database,
  the custom   fields are hidden to make it more clear what's going on.
> File download redirection now modifed so it can be easily turned on and off.
> Feature for adding new buddies is now implemented in the compose message
  facility to improve user-friendliness.
> CMS accounts can now be disabled via the 'enabled' var in the 'clans' table.

  limit, instead of sending the user back to the create/edit page, it will
  now send them back to the admin page so an error message may be shown.
> Config array now cleaned before parsed onto templates as it contains an
  element of sensitive information.

=============== 
+ 4.3.4 + ( Released 25/11/03 )
===============
> Streamlined "FileServer" integration; now fileserver only needs crucial
  files and can update the bandwidth usage back on the core server.
> Applied a more constant date/time format which is now has the potential
  to be customized by the user (needs further implementation).
> Fixed non-common create_date variable for news->details, templates were
  refering to it's old varable (date).
> Tidied up poll SQL queries; now each query is safely assigned to it's own
  variable, so that within loops, each query dosen't intefere with the others.
> Dual database system introduced; files are now stored on a remote server
  if specified, and redirect script now directs the user to that server.
> Now directs user to appropriate server depending on the nature of the
  query; files come from RackShack, core files come from Appro.
> Configuration files re-arranged for added extensibility; server_conf now
  uses and array, this array is then merged with the main cfg array later on.
> Database failure now hidden for user for added CMS security, unless CMS is
  on the dev server, in which all the error details are shown.

===============

  and comments, etc; "Uknown Author" is now shown instead of the name, and

> The module used in the "messages" returned from when modifications are
  made to the user's CMS can now be overridden by putting the module id,

> If a member is removed and buddy list removal fails, all the subsiquent 
  buddy lists they have been added to will return an error because the member
  dosen't exist! This did return a MySQL error but, this has been fixed so
  only "n/a" shows up on the page.

  an item / group of items have been updated. If one item has been deleted
  it displays the sigular message and for more than one, displays plural.

  came from site's front end or admin end and displays the correct path.
> Instead of template specifying an action is from an admin page, function
  now stats what the last action was in the HTTP_REFERER string; this feature
  is used in PathFinder to determine what path to show (normal or admin).

  as the message control page is now always open for logged in users.

  PathFinder temporarily depreciated for now. 
> Larger PathFinder structures are now included from a seporate directory 
  to tidy up / minimize source code within modules.

  edit actions for the Fixtures module.

  delete/message/linux/windows/etc).

  site in erlier versions.

  by about 3 seconds - 75%).

  Files, Polls, Trophies, Reports.

  sections for modules.
